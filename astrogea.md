The astrogea library should have this overall structure:

A stateful behavior where the user can prepare the connection to data sources. Then executing steps in a lazy manner, allowing for efficient data processing and retrieval.

State preparation should include: 
	- Defining the data sources, specifying any necessary authentication or configuration details, and establishing a connection to the data sources.
	- Eventually the choice working in-place or on a copy of the data.
	- Defining the computing environment, resources
	- Defining the data fragmentation strategy, including how data will be partitioned or sharded across different nodes or processes.
	- Validating the data sources and configurations to ensure they are correctly set up and accessible.

Pipeline execution should include:
	- Defining the data processing pipeline, including the sequence of tasks to be performed on the data.
	- Executing the data processing pipeline in a lazy manner, allowing for efficient use of resources and minimizing unnecessary computations.
	- Monitoring the progress of the pipeline execution, including logging and error handling.
	- Retrieving the processed data from the computing environment back to the local environment, if necessary.

Technically it should be implemented as an object-oriented library, with classes and methods to encapsulate the various components of the data processing pipeline.
Just for example and not meant to be exhaustive or conclusive:

astrogea = Astrogea()

// Loading data sources
astrogea.add_local_data_source("source1", config) 
astrogea.add_s3_data_source("source2", s3_config)
astrogea.add_azure_blob_data_source("source3", azure_config)

astrogea.add_target_data_source("in-place")
astrogea.add_target_data_source("copy", target_config)

// Data source validation
astrogea.validate_data_sources()

// Setting the data fragmentation strategy
astrogea.automate_data_fragmentation()
astrogea.ram_proportional_data_fragmentation()

// Setting the computing environment
astrogea.local_computing_environment_processes(...)
astrogea.local_computing_environment_threads(...)
astrogea.k8s_deployment(...)
astrogea.azure_deployment(...)

// Validating the computing environment
astrogea.validate_computing_environment() // Small test run

// Setting the data processing pipeline
astrogea.preprocess("task1")
astrogea.process("task2")
astrogea.postprocess("task3")

// Pipeline execution
astrogea.execute_pipeline()
// Start stop ....

// Data retrieval
astrogea.retrieve_data_to_local()
